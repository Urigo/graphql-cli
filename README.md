# graphql-cli

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-cli) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/graphql-cli/graphql-cli.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)

ðŸ“Ÿ Command line tool for common GraphQL development workflows

## Features

- Helpful commands to improve your workflows like `get-schema`, `diff` & `playground`
- Compatible with editors and IDEs based on [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config)
- Powerful plugin system to extend `graphql-cli` with custom commands

You can see it in action here:

> Note: The `graphql-cli` has a different use case than the [Graphcool CLI](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphcool-cli/overview-zboghez5go/). Graphcool CLI is specific to the Graphcool Framework, while `graphql-cli` can be used with any GraphQL project.

## Install

You can simply install the CLI using `npm` or `yarn` by running the following command. This will add the `graphql` (and shorter `gql`) binary to your path.

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```
